# Introduction

This is REST API Development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

# <a>Installation Guide</a>

This project requires the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The JavaScript environment for server-side code.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - A Node.js package manager used to install dependencies.

## Getting Started

**Step 1. Clone the code into a fresh folder**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/furkankahvecii/nodejs-projects
$ cd 02-RestAPI
```

**Step 2. Install Dependencies.**

Next, we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `package.json`.

```
$ npm install
```

Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
$ nodemon app
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and warnings in the console.
